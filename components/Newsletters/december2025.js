          content: `• The assessee, a private limited company, filed its income tax return for AY 2015–16. It had issued equity shares at face value along with a share premium. The value of the shares was determined using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, supported by a valuation report from a qualified accountant. The case was selected for scrutiny, and the Assessing Officer (AO) completed the assessment under Section 143(3), accepting the returned income.

• Later, the Principal Commissioner invoked Section 263, stating that the assessment was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, and directed the AO to pass a fresh assessment order.

• In the consequential assessment under Section 143(3) read with Section 263, the AO rejected the DCF valuation. The AO held that the DCF method was based on actual future performance rather than reasonable projections available on the valuation date and claimed that the NAV method was more appropriate.

• The assessee appealed before the Tribunal. The Tribunal held that:
• The assessee had rightly chosen the DCF method, which is a prescribed and accepted valuation method.
• The choice of valuation method cannot be questioned by the AO once it is permitted under law.
• The AO was wrong in comparing DCF projections with actual future revenues and profits.
• Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the AO had wrongly rejected the DCF method. The order of the Commissioner (Appeals) / NFAC was upheld, and the addition made under Section 56(2)(viib) was deleted.`

• The TPO rejected the assessee's TP study, conducted fresh benchmarking, and determined higher ALPs for both segments. Receivables outstanding beyond 30 days were treated as loans, and notional interest at 13.62% (SBI PLR) was imputed.

• The DRP deleted the TP adjustments for software and ITeS services but directed interest on outstanding receivables at LIBOR plus 350 bps, citing LIBOR as a standard benchmark for cross-border financing. The assessee contested the upward ALP adjustments, the classification of receivables as loans, and the notional interest, arguing that the granted credit period was reasonable and already reflected in operating margins.

• The Tribunal held that LIBOR was an inappropriate benchmark, and the DRP's rate was ad hoc.
• It observed that outstanding receivables constitute short-term inter-company financing, and interest should reflect invoice currency and associated risk.
• The matter was remanded to the AO to benchmark receivables based on invoice currency and examine working capital adjustments for the software and ITeS segments.`

          content: `The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in Hansaben Jayantibhai Patel addressed whether ITC could be availed on differential IGST paid pursuant to pre-notice consultation letter issued under Section 28(1) of Customs Act, 1962. The AAR held that neither the pre-consultation letter nor the duty paying document (challan) are prescribed documents under Section 16(2) of CGST Act and Rule 36(1) of CGST Rules for availing ITC. The Authority applied the ejusdem generis principle of interpretation to the term 'similar document' mentioned in Rule 36(1)(d), holding that it must be of the same genus as the preceding words "Bill of Entry", which would include customs declarations and forms but not pre-consultation letters.

The AAR further clarified that challans are also not prescribed documents for availing ITC, citing Board Circular No. 16/2023-Customs which explicitly clarified this position under GST law. Since the fundamental eligibility for ITC was denied, the AAR held that the question of applicability of time limit prescribed under Section 16(4) did not arise and was consequently not answered.`

          subheading: "",
          content: `The Gauhati High Court in M/s McLeod Russel India Limited addressed the constitutional validity of Section 16(2)(aa) of CGST Act, which makes ITC availability to recipients contingent on suppliers furnishing invoice details in GSTR-1 returns. The petitioner challenged this provision as arbitrary and unconstitutional, arguing it restricts vested rights of bona fide recipients due to supplier defaults beyond their control.

The Court recognized that Section 16(2)(aa) places onerous burden on purchasing dealers as ITC availability depends on factors controlled by suppliers, not purchasers. The provision imposes impossible burden on purchasers to verify supplier's GSTR-1 details and auto-population in their GSTR-2A/2B, while GST laws currently provide no mechanism for purchasers to address supplier non-disclosure despite correct tax payment in GSTR-3B. Making ITC denial contingent on invoice reflection in GSTR-2A/2B was held arbitrary.

The Court held that denying ITC to purchasing dealers for supplier defaults amounts to shifting tax incidence from supplier to buyer, which is unconstitutional and contrary to GST Act's objective of avoiding cascading taxation and charging only on value additions. However, recognizing the provision's objective to prevent fraudulent ITC claims and promote supplier compliance, the Court refrained from declaring the amendment unconstitutional.

Instead, Section 16(2)(aa) was read down to require authorities to provide bona fide purchasers opportunity to prove their bona fides through tax invoices and other documents before denying ITC benefits when suppliers act truant. This reading down applies until CBIC develops practical solutions addressing the issue of ITC availability to bona fide purchasers being contingent on supplier-controlled factors.`

          subheading: "",
          content: `The Bombay High Court in M/s Duphar Interfran Ltd addressed whether the sale of a trademark constitutes a local sale within the State or a sale in the course of export. The applicant company owned the trademark 'Crocin' registered in India and sold this trademark to a UK-based company, SKB, through a Brand Acquisition Agreement. The Commissioner of Sales Tax held that the assignment of the trademark was a local sale in Maharashtra liable to 4% sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The issue was whether the sale of the trademark 'Crocin' was a sale within the State of Maharashtra liable to sales tax or a sale in the course of export out of the territory of India not liable to tax.

The Court relied on the principle of "mobilia sequuntur personam" which means movables follow the owner. Applying this principle to intangible assets, the Court held that the situs of an intangible asset like a trademark follows the situs of its owner. The Court referred to the decision in Mahyco Monsanto v. Union of India, which established that the location of intangible property is determined by the location of its owner rather than any physical registration or documentation.

The Court emphasized that since the assignee SKB was based in the UK, the situs of the trademark moved to the UK upon assignment, making it a sale in the course of export under Section 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act. The Court rejected the argument that the place of registration of the trademark determines its situs, clarifying that registration is not the sole determinant of location for intangible assets. The assignment itself transfers the ownership rights, and with that transfer, the legal situs of the trademark shifts to follow its new owner.

Accordingly, the Court held that the sale of the intangible trademark 'Crocin' through the Brand Acquisition Agreement was a sale in the course of export outside India under Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, and not a sale within the State of Maharashtra under Section 4.`

          content: `The Chandigarh Tribunal in M/s NC Jindal Institute of Medical Care & Research addressed whether revenue sharing arrangements between a hospital and diagnostic service providers (DSPs) constitute taxable Business Support Services. The appellants had entered into agreements with DSPs for providing pathology lab and other diagnostic services in the hospital. As per the agreements, the appellants provided basic amenities such as space, water, electricity and other facilities to DSPs for functioning, and the DSPs installed and operated their equipment in the appellant's premises. The DSPs rendered services to patients both within hospital premises and outside hospital premises.

The Tribunal noted that the appellants raised invoices on patients for diagnostic services rendered in the hospital and shared the receipts with DSPs in an agreed percentage. This was essentially a revenue sharing arrangement rather than a service provider-client relationship. The Tribunal observed that the issue relating to revenue sharing arrangements between the appellants and DSPs was no longer res integra, meaning it was a settled question of law. The Tribunal as well as the departmental Appellate Authority had decided the issue in favour of the appellants for earlier and subsequent periods by consistently holding that revenue sharing arrangements are not subject to service tax under Business Support Services.

Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the revenue sharing arrangements between the hospital and diagnostic service providers did not constitute taxable Business Support Services. The appeals were allowed in favor of the appellants.`

          content: `The Kolkata Tribunal in M/s Face IT Systems LLP addressed the classification of imported "Access Controller Face Recognition System" under the Customs Tariff. The issue was whether the imported goods are properly classifiable under CTH 8471 as "Automatic Data Processing Machines" with NIL duty or under CTH 8543 as "Electrical Machines and Apparatus" with 7.5% basic customs duty.

The Tribunal examined the nature and functionality of the imported goods in light of the relevant tariff provisions. The Tribunal noted that the imported goods possessed the essential functions of storing, processing, and executing programs without human intervention. These characteristics are fundamental requirements under Chapter Note 6(A) to Chapter 84 of the Customs Tariff for goods to be classified as Automatic Data Processing Machines. The face recognition access controller systems imported by the appellant could store facial data, process that information through recognition algorithms, and execute access control decisions automatically based on the programmed parameters.

The Tribunal rejected the revenue's contention that the goods are classifiable under CTH 8543 as "Electrical Machines and Apparatus". Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the imported goods are properly classifiable under CTH 8471 as "Automatic Data Processing Machines" and are entitled to the NIL duty benefit claimed by the appellant. The impugned order reclassifying the goods and imposing differential duty, interest, and penalties was set aside, and the appeal was allowed in favor of the appellant.`

This practice guidance serves as a guide for directors, particularly those who serve on audit committees in fulfilling their duties as directors. In reviewing the financial statements, ACRA advises the audit committees to exercise heightened vigilance given the prevailing uncertainties in business environment, particularly those arising from evolving global trade, tariff policies, and climate related risks, and assess their potential impacts on the financial statements.

ACRA states that since high quality audits are essential for fostering confidence and trust in financial markets, audit committees should engage external auditors early in the audit process to ensure accounting issues are addressed appropriately to comply with the accounting standards.

The Bill will come into operation on a date that the Minister appoints by notification in the Gazette. The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) has indicated that sufficient lead time will be provided for the implementation of the proposed amendments, and that most of the provisions of the Bill are targeted to commence from April 2026 onwards.

The Bill's key amendments relate to the Companies Act 1967, the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, and the Accountants Act 2004.

Key aspects of the amendments include:
• Preventing Misuse of Companies: Rules are tightened to allow the Registrar to refuse registration or restoration of certain entities if they are likely to be used for unlawful purposes or purposes against national interest.
• Safeguarding Shareholders' Interests: A two-tier approval process for selective off-market share purchases is introduced.
• Strengthening the Regulatory Framework: Penalties are increased for directors who fail in their duty to manage the company in its best interests.
• Reducing Regulatory Burden: The requirement for a company's registered office to be open for public inspection has been removed; companies only need to make records available for inspection for a minimum of two hours during business days upon reasonable notice.

          content: `The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released a consultation paper outlining proposed Guidelines on AI Risk Management aimed at guiding financial institutions (FIs) on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in the financial sector.

The Guidelines will apply to all FIs, detailing MAS's supervisory expectations regarding AI risk oversight, management systems, policies, lifecycle controls, and the necessary capabilities for AI deployment. Recognising the diverse applications and varying risk profiles associated with AI use, the Guidelines are designed to be broadly applicable yet proportionate to the size, nature, and AI usage of each institution. They cover a wide range of AI technologies, including Generative AI and emerging AI agents.

Key areas addressed include:
• Governance and oversight by boards and senior management to establish risk management frameworks and foster an appropriate risk culture.
• Clear identification and inventory of AI applications within firms, alongside risk materiality assessments considering impact, complexity, and reliance.
• Lifecycle controls focusing on data management, fairness, transparency, human oversight, third-party risks, evaluation, monitoring, and change management, applied proportionately to risk levels.
• Ensuring adequate organisational capabilities and capacity to support AI use.

These Guidelines build on MAS's 2024 thematic review of AI use in key banks and consultations with industry players. MAS has invited public feedback on the proposals by 31st January 2026.

The initiative aims to enable financial institutions to innovate responsibly while managing AI-related risks effectively.

          heading: "Stay Safe from OneDrive's Latest Security Threat",
          subheading: "",
          content: `A serious vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft OneDrive that allows malicious websites to access your entire file system without your permission. Once triggered, attackers can browse, download, or even manipulate your cloud files—all without needing your password. Because OneDrive is deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 and Windows, this flaw has wide-reaching implications for both individual and enterprise users. The attack is typically launched through deceptive links, making awareness and caution essential.

The flaw stems from how OneDrive handles link sharing and session tokens. Attackers use social engineering—tricking users into clicking fake login or sharing links. These links exploit OneDrive's web-based authentication, giving websites access to your files without triggering any obvious warnings. Importantly, this doesn't require the attacker to know your credentials. Instead, it hijacks trust by using browser sessions and token-based access to gain control. In an organizational setting, the threat is even greater: one compromised account can expose shared folders, internal files, or sensitive client data.

To stay protected, be cautious with links by avoiding unexpected or suspicious ones, especially those that claim to share OneDrive files. Always verify the source before opening any link. Regularly review and revoke access for unfamiliar or unused apps and services connected to your Microsoft account. Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if session tokens are compromised. It's also important to audit your shared files—review documents and folders, removing unnecessary sharing links or restricting access to specific people instead of "anyone with the link." Keep your browser secure by using the latest versions and avoiding untrusted extensions or scripts that could expose your data. Lastly, educate your team to ensure everyone understands the risks and follows safe practices to prevent accidental exposure.`

          heading: "Gujarat Appellate AAR – ITC ineligible on Share Buyback Expenses",
          subheading: "Input Tax Credit on Financial/Commercial Credit Notes",
          content: "The Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd upheld the denial of Input Tax Credit on expenditure incurred for buyback of shares. The appellant challenged the original AAR ruling that disallowed ITC on expenses related to share buyback activities.\n\nThe Appellate Authority held that while goods or services must be used in furtherance of business for ITC eligibility, not every activity furthering business qualifies for credit. Section 17(2) of the CGST Act restricts ITC to taxable supplies including zero-rated supplies and categorically denies credit for goods or services used for exempt supplies. Since shares are securities and are neither goods nor services, transactions in securities do not constitute supply under GST and are not taxable.\n\nThe ruling emphasized that Section 17(2) restricts ITC allowance to expenses attributable to taxable supplies. Tax paid on goods or services used for security transactions, which are not even supplies under GST, cannot be claimed as input tax credit. The argument that buyback activities further business objectives was held irrelevant, as the law specifically excludes transactions in securities from ITC eligibility.\n\nRegarding reversal of ITC on common inputs and input services, the Appellate Authority ruled that Section 17(3) includes \"value of transaction in securities\" within the definition of exempt supply, thereby mandating reversal of ITC attributable to such transactions. The appellant was required to reverse ITC on common inputs and input services used for share buyback expenditure. The appeal was dismissed on both counts."

          content: "The Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Zydus Lifesciences Ltd upheld the original AAR ruling on ITC eligibility for expenses related to mutual fund subscription and redemption. The appellant in this case sought clarity on ITC eligibility on common inputs and input services used towards redemption of mutual fund investments.\n\nThe Appellate Authority rejected the argument that mutual fund redemption differs from sale of securities, holding that under the common parlance test, redemption constitutes sale of mutual fund units back to the Asset Management Company. A conjoint reading of Section 17(3) and the explanation to CGST Rules reveals that mutual fund transactions must be treated as exempt supplies for ITC reversal calculations."

          subheading: "",
          content: "The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Priya Holdings Pvt Limited ruled on the applicability of the second proviso to Section 16(2) of CGST Act concerning ITC on imported goods where payment to foreign suppliers is deferred beyond 180 days.\n\nThe AAR held that ITC of IGST paid on imported goods remains admissible even when payment to foreign suppliers is deferred beyond 180 days, provided such payment falls within time limits permitted under FEMA and RBI guidelines. The ruling clarified that the second proviso to Section 16(2), which requires payment within 180 days for ITC eligibility, does not apply to import of goods where IGST has already been discharged at the time of import.\n\nThe AAR reasoned that the intent behind the second proviso was to prevent tax evasion, which is not applicable in import scenarios as government revenue is already protected through IGST payment at customs clearance stage. Denying ITC on grounds of non-payment to foreign suppliers when IGST already stands paid would amount to treating equals as unequal, which is impermissible under law."

          heading: "Bombay High Court - Effect of Omission of Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) Without Savings Clause",
          subheading: "",
          content: "The Bombay High Court in a batch of writ petitions ruled on the effect of omission of Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) of CGST Rules, 2017, which had imposed conditions for claiming refund of IGST paid on exports. The impugned rules were omitted through notification dated 8th October 2024 without any savings clause while multiple petitions challenging their constitutional validity were pending before various High Courts.\n\nThe Court held that show cause notices and orders issued under the omitted rules could not be enforced as they had not attained finality before the rules were omitted. The Court applied the common law principle that repeal or omission without savings clause obliterates the repealed provision from the statute book. Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) were held to be not purely procedural but impacting substantive rights of parties, and their removal essentially erased these rules from existence as if they had never been enacted.\n\nThe Court clarified that omitted rules should be regarded as provisions that never existed, except for transactions past and closed. Since none of the impugned show cause notices or orders had attained finality, they could not be regarded as transactions past and closed and therefore lapsed upon omission of the rules. The Court rejected the revenue's argument that Section 174(3) of CGST Act or Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897 saved pending proceedings.\n\nThe Court specifically held that Section 6 of General Clauses Act does not apply as the impugned rules were omitted by notification and not by Central Act or Regulation as required under Section 6, relying on Constitution Bench decisions in Rayala Corporation Pvt Ltd and Kolhapur Cane Sugar Works Ltd. The impugned show cause notices and orders were quashed, and authorities were directed to consider and dispose of petitioners' refund applications within four months."

          heading: "Supreme Court - SEZ unit's entitlement to ITC refund (question of law kept open)",
          subheading: "",
          content: "The Supreme Court in Meghmani Organochem Limited dismissed the revenue's Special Leave Petition challenging a High Court decision that allowed an SEZ Unit to claim refund of unutilised Input Tax Credit. The revenue contended that only the supplier could claim refund of unutilised ITC and not the SEZ Unit itself.\n\nThe High Court had accepted the SEZ Unit's argument that it was entitled to claim refund of unutilised ITC on the ground that exports were made without payment of tax under Letter of Undertaking. The Supreme Court, considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the amount ordered to be refunded, declined to interfere with the High Court's order.\n\nImportantly, the Supreme Court kept the question of law open, indicating that this decision should not be treated as a binding precedent on the legal issue. This means the issue may be revisited in future cases. The decision provides temporary relief but leaves legal uncertainty on this aspect of SEZ refund claims."

          content: "The Delhi Customs Tribunal (CESTAT) in M/s HCL Technologies Ltd & M/s SAP India Pvt Ltd ruled on whether license fees paid for SAP software should be included in the transaction value of imported CDs containing the software under Rule 9(1)(c) of Customs Valuation Rules, 1988. The case involved HCL importing physical CDs from SAP and separately paying license fees to SAP India for software usage rights.\n\nThe Tribunal held that license fees paid by HCL to SAP India cannot be included in the transaction value of imported CDs. The ruling established that license fees are not associated with the import of physical goods, as the primary delivery mode for SAP Software is electronic. The license fees remain payable regardless of whether CDs are obtained physically or not, demonstrating that the fees relate to intangible rights for software use rather than the imported physical media.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasized that the obligation to pay license fees arises subsequently for obtaining the license key required to access full software functionality, making it a post-importation activity rather than a condition of sale for the goods. Since the primary software delivery mode was electronic and license fees remained payable independent of physical CD import, the value of license fees could not be included under Rule 9(1)(c) of the Valuation Rules."

Those taxpayers whose Aadhaar authentication is not completed shall not be allowed refund on a provisional basis.\n\nFor zero-rated supplies, low-risk refund applications will receive 90% provisional sanction without detailed scrutiny within seven days once Form GST RFD-02 (refund acknowledgment) is issued. However, officers may deny provisional refund on case-by-case basis with written reasons, proceeding instead with detailed examination. Applications not categorized as low-risk undergo full scrutiny before refund sanction."

          content: "The CBIC had issued Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST dated 26th June 2024 establishing mechanisms for suppliers to demonstrate compliance with Section 15(3)(b)(ii) of the CGST Act regarding post-sale discounts offered through tax credit notes. The provision requires recipients to reverse proportionate input tax credit attributable to such discounts for suppliers to exclude them from taxable value.\n\nThe Board acknowledged that currently no system functionality exists on the common portal for suppliers or tax officers to verify whether recipients have reversed the required input tax credit. Until such portal functionality is developed, suppliers must obtain certificates from recipients as evidence of ITC reversal compliance.\n\nFor discounts where the tax amount involved exceeds Rs 5 lakhs in a financial year, suppliers must procure certificates from Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants certifying that recipients have reversed the required proportionate input tax credit. These certificates must contain details of credit notes, relevant invoice numbers, ITC reversal amounts, and references to Form GST DRC-03 or returns showing such reversals. All certificates must include Unique Document Identification Numbers verifiable through ICAI or ICMAI websites.\n\nFor discounts involving tax amounts not exceeding Rs 5 lakhs per financial year per recipient, suppliers may obtain undertakings or certificates directly from recipients instead of professional certifications. These certificates and undertakings constitute suitable admissible evidence under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) and must be produced during scrutiny, audit, or investigation proceedings. The mechanism applies retrospectively, allowing suppliers to procure such evidence for past periods where required by tax authorities.\n\nUPDATE: This circular has been withdrawn vide Circular No. 253/10/2025-GST dated 1st October 2025. The procedure prescribed for providing evidence of compliance under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) is no longer required."

The ruling established that foreign vendors had not transferred the right to use software to the appellant but only granted nonexclusive intellectual property rights to distribute products. The End User License Agreement existed between foreign vendors and end-users, with the appellant merely providing unique activation keys to end-users as an intermediary in the distribution chain.\n\nBased on the distribution agreement terms and following precedents in Sakri IT Solutions Pvt Ltd and Quick Heal Technologies Ltd, the Tribunal concluded the transaction amounted to deemed sale of goods rather than service provision."

Financial institutions will need to consider how to put in place new processes for appropriateness assessments in this regard, which will be challenging;\n\n2. financial institutions should assess the characteristics and limitations of digital media, address the associated risks, and ensure that important and meaningful disclosures are presented prominently and clearly. MAS has provided an extensive list of examples of disclosures to be included;\n\n3. financial institutions should assess and select appropriate digital marketers, and ensure these digital marketers are adequately apprised and comply with the institutions' digital advertising practices and regulatory requirements;\n\n4. financial institutions should monitor digital advertising activities conducted by their digital marketers to ensure effective oversight of these activities; and\n\n5. financial institutions should take appropriate disciplinary action against digital marketers to deter malpractices and errant conduct related to digital advertising.\n\nThe Guidelines also emphasise that the MAS will hold the Board and Senior Management accountable for ensuring that their financial institution's digital advertising activities are conducted in accordance with the Guidelines. We can read this as a stern warning to financial institutions on the importance of proactive engagement with the Guidelines by all financial institutions."
